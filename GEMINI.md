# Gemini Code Assistant Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the `mcts-lib` project, generated by the Gemini Code Assistant.

## Project Description

`mcts-lib` is a Rust library that provides a generic implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm used in decision-making processes, most notably in game AI. The library is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various turn-based games.

## Key Technologies

- **Language:** Rust
- **Core Algorithm:** Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

## Core Components

The project is structured into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

- **`mcts`**: This is the heart of the library, containing the `MonteCarloTreeSearch` struct. This struct orchestrates the four main steps of the MCTS algorithm:
    1.  **Selection:** Traversing the tree to find a promising node.
    2.  **Expansion:** Adding new nodes to the tree.
    3.  **Simulation:** Running a random playout from a new node.
    4.  **Backpropagation:** Updating the statistics of the nodes based on the simulation result.

- **`board`**: This module defines the `Board` trait, which is the primary interface for integrating a new game with the MCTS engine. To use the library with a specific game, you need to implement this trait for your game's state representation. The trait requires methods for:
    - Getting the current player.
    - Determining the game's outcome (win, loss, draw, or in-progress).
    - Listing available moves.
    - Applying a move to the board.

- **`mcts_node`**: This module defines the `MctsNode` struct, which represents a single node in the search tree. Each node stores information about a specific game state, including visit counts, win/draw statistics, and the move that led to this state.

- **`boards`**: This module contains concrete implementations of the `Board` trait for specific games. Currently, it includes an implementation for **Tic-Tac-Toe**, which also serves as a good example of how to use the library.

- **`random`**: This module provides a trait for random number generation, which is crucial for the simulation phase of the MCTS algorithm.

- **`hash`**: This module contains a utility for hashing the MCTS tree, which can be useful for debugging and testing.

## How to Use

To use this library in your own project, you would typically follow these steps:

1.  **Define your game state:** Create a struct or enum that represents the state of your game.
2.  **Implement the `Board` trait:** Implement the `Board` trait for your game state struct. This will involve defining the logic for making moves, checking for game termination, and identifying the current player.
3.  **Instantiate `MonteCarloTreeSearch`:** Create an instance of the `MonteCarloTreeSearch` struct, providing it with an initial game state.
4.  **Run the search:** Call the `iterate_n_times` method to run the MCTS algorithm for a specified number of iterations.
5.  **Get the best move:** Use the `get_most_perspective_move` method to retrieve the move that the MCTS algorithm has identified as the most promising.

## Building and Testing

The project uses Cargo, the standard Rust build tool and package manager.

- To build the project, run:
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

- To run the tests, which include simulations on the Tic-Tac-Toe board, execute:
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```
